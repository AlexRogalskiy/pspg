# pspg - Postgres Pager

Everybody who uses `psql` uses `less` pager. It is working well, but there is not any support for tabular data. I found few projects, but no one was well specialized for this purpose. So I decided to write some small specialized pager for usage as `psql` pager.

## Main target
* possibility to freeze first few rows, first few colums
* possibility to use fancy colors - like `mcview` or `FoxPro`
